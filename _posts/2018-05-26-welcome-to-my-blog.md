Welcome to my new blog. My name is Bryce.

I am currently a software engineer in the financial tech sector. I've been programming professionally for about 3 years now. Lately at work we've come up against a string of very hard problems and I decided that I should document them. I find software development challenges really interesting and it would be nice to see what other people think of them.

I'm not a great blogger so my posts will probably be pretty short. I'll implement some sort of comments system once I figure out how.
