Welcome to my new blog. My name is Bryce.

I am currently a software engineer in the financial tech sector. I've been programming professionally for about 3 years now. Lately at work we've come up against a string of very hard problems and I decided that I should document them. I find software development challenges really interesting and it would be nice to see what other people think of them.

I mostly work in C# and F#, but I like to think of myself as a polyglot developer. Some frameworks and tools I've been using are WCF, NServiceBus, Ninject, and Enterprise Library. Recently I did some dabbling in React, but I'm not a fan of frontend work. Our build scripting is also in Ruby so I've been picking up a bit of that. I've also been enjoying learning more about shell scripting with tools like sed and awk.

I'm not a great blogger so my posts will probably be pretty short. I'll implement some sort of comments system once I figure out how.
